Selected Projects
- Structured Pruning for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs):
  - Implemented magnitude-based structured weight pruning method to improve the performance of its hardware
  - implementation, by keeping number of NNZ values per channel fixed to help load balancing. (Python, Tensorflow).
- CUDA Implementation of Sparse DNNs:
  - Implemented a high-performance CUDA implementation of structurly sparse DNN and compared its performance with
  - NVIDIA libraries for dense and sparse DNNs: (cuDNN, cuBLAS and cuSPARSE). (C++, CUDA).
- Benchmarking Vision Kernels and Neural Network Inference Accelerators on Embedded Platforms [1]:
  - Conducted comprehensive benchmarks of accuracy, run-time, and energy efficiency of a wide range of vision kernels and neural networks on multiple embedded platforms: ARM57 CPU, Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU and Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. (xFOpenCV, OpenCV, VisionWorks)
